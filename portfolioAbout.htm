  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am a university student in California, but I was born<br>and raised in
    New Jersey. I'm currently studying cognitive science <br>with a minor in
    computer science. I've always been passionate about art <br> and I hope to
    share my excitement with others through my designs.

  <button type="button" class="collapsible">Website Purpose</button>
  <div class="content">
    <p class="content__text"> Not only does this website act as my portfolio,
    but it was also a productive way for me to teach myself front-end
    programming. I designed this website and programmed everything using html,
    CSS and JavaScript. This was my first time doing front-end development, so
    there is still much to improve on. Thus, I plan on developing this website
    as well as start more projects in the future.
